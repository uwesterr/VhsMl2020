In the following sections examples of ML applications from a wider field of industries are given. Those applications might inspire new projects by showcasing ideas and approaches which might not be straight forward. Sometimes processes need be thought the other way round to achieve faster solutions.

Also as the example DeepL in chapter \@ref(deepl) shows, it might be possible to stand up to the tech giants from overseas event though all odds seems to be against the idea of taken them on.

## AI translation by DeepL {#deepl}

A good example to show that even small companies can be successful in areas where large companies seem to have an unassailable lead. When it comes to language, few would deny that Google has the largest data set available, but it seems that DeepL has an advantage over them.

<blockquote>

Tech giants Google, Microsoft and Facebook are all applying the lessons of machine learning to translation, but a small company called DeepL has outdone them all and raised the bar for the field.
Its translation tool is just as quick as the outsized competition, but more accurate and nuanced than any we’ve tried.

Text translation service by DeepL
<div class="rmdtip">
**DeepL facts:**

- Launch of DeepL Translator in August 2017
- Headquarter in Cologne 
- more than 500 Mio users
- Uses neural network
- Up to 5000 characters for free

</div>

A test by external professional translators showed that DeepL outperforms other translation services by quite some margin

<div class="rmdtip">
**Comparision DeepL and competitors:**

- 119 paragraphs
- different domains
- external professional translators
- blind test comparison

</div>

<blockquote>



119 paragraphs from different domains were translated by the various systems. External professional translators were hired to review the translations - without information about which system produced which translation. The graph displays how often each system’s translations were rated better than all other translations. Not shown are cases where several systems produced the best translation. The tests were performed in January 2020.

## Artificial intelligence detects myocardial infarctions in the ECG more reliably than cardiologistsn

The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kardiologie - Herz- und Kreislaufforschung e.V.(DKG) developed an algorithm for machine learning that, with the help of ECG interpretation, can detect a myocardial infarction that has occurred within the last 3 months more reliably than a cardiologist.


![Figure from  [@makimotokunstliche]](images/infarktDkg.png){width=80% .external}

<div class="rmdtip">

**Project details:**  

- Used deep learning  
- Train to answer the following question:
    - Is this an ECG of a patient who's had an Myocardial infarction in the last three months?
- Compared with 9 cardiologist
    - algorithm is more reliable 
- Explainability of ML prediction was addressed

</div>

To better understand how the ML algorithm deducted the prediction a heatmap of the ECG was produced. The red areas show the focus of the ML algorithm.

<div class="rmdtip">

- A deep learning model is trained to predict antibiotics based on structure
- Halicin is predicted as an antibacterial molecule from the Drug Repurposing Hub

## Fundamental limits from chaos on instability time predictions in compact planetary systems {#StabilityPlanetarySystem}

In the paper "Predicting the long-term stability of compact multiplanet systems" [@tamayo2020predicting] an interesting approach to replace simulation runs by a machine learning algorithm.



Astrophysics is a science which has a long history of handling huge amount of data, no wonder that there are also ML applications in this field. This application helps to determine whether or not a planetary system will be stable. Until now the stability is determined by calculating an astonishing $10^9$ orbits. Reducing simulation time by factor of 10,000 by combining analytical understanding of resonant dynamics in two-planet systems with machine learning was accomplished.

<div class="rmdtip">

**Reducing simulation time:**

- Combine
    - analytical understanding
    - machine learning (XGBoost)
    - calculation of only $10^4$ orbits instead of 1$0^9$

</div>

The following graph shows the flow of computation and the utilization of machine learning to reduce the number of necessary simulations.

<div class="rmdtip">

**Training the model:**

- simulate 100,000 initial conditions simulated
    - 80% training set
     - 20% test set
    - machine learning (XGBoost)

<div class="rmdtip">

**Comparison between SPOCK and previous models:**

- At a false positive rate: 10% SPOCK has
    - True positive rate: 85%

## Machine Learning Algorithms and Global Optimization Methods for SPICE Model Parameter Extraction {#ErmittlungVonSimulationsParametern}

Another interesting approach is to substitute a lengthy parameter search for a simulation model by reversing the task. Instead of matching simulation to measurement results by tuning the simulation parameter, extract simulation parameter from measurement results. The goal is to find simulation parameters for a semiconductor (BSIM4 MOSFET model)

<div class="rmdtip">

**Project details:**

- Previous method:
    - match simulation to measurement results by tuning simulation parameters
    - 34 different optimization steps
    - tuned by skilled workers (PhD)
- ML method:
    - extract simulation parameters from measurement results
    - training data can be generated by running simulations
    - simulation run time was short 
    - 10s of thousands of training data can be generated
    - validation of predictions by simulation
        - run simulation with predicted simulation parameters
        - compare simulation to measurement results

</div>



The previous method required a educated comparison of simulation and measurement results, based on the comparison the simulation parameter were tuned.

---



In the ML method measurement data are converted to a set of feature which are then used as input of the machine model. The simulation parameters can then be calculated in one step. Validation of the result can be achieved by running the simulation with the predicted simulation parameters.
