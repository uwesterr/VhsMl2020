### Example for self-driving car course project


During the course there are a number of projects which have to be finished successfully before going to the next stage. 

<div class="rmdtip">

Example project: 

Model predictive control:

- Drive car around track
- Combine
    - neural network
    - model predictive controller 
- Including 100ms latency between actuation commands    

</div>

The resulting driving performance can be seen in the following video

## fast.ai

Deep learning is transforming the world. fast.ai making deep learning easier to use and getting more people from all backgrounds involved through their:

- free courses for coders
- software library
- cutting-edge research
- community

The world needs everyone involved with AI, no matter how unlikely your background.

The fast.ai slogan

<blockquote>


Being cool is about being exclusive, and that’s the opposite of what we want. We want to make deep learning as accessible as possible– including to people using uncool languages like C#, uncool operating systems like Windows (which is used by the majority of the world), uncool datasets (way smaller than anything at Google, and in domain areas you’d consider obscure), and with uncool backgrounds (maybe you didn’t go to Stanford).
</blockquote>


### fast.ai Book


The  notebooks cover an introduction to deep learning, fastai, and PyTorch. fastai is a layered API for deep learning; for more information, see the [fastai paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/2/108). Everything in this repo is copyright Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger, 2020 onwards.

## Full Stack Deep Learning

https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com

Since 2012, deep learning has lead to remarkable progress across a variety of challenging computing tasks, from image recognition to speech recognition, robotics, and audio synthesis. Deep learning has the potential to enable a new set of previously infeasible technologies like autonomous vehicles, real-time translation, and voice assistants and help reinvent existing software categories.
There are many great courses to learn how to train deep neural networks. However, training the model is just one part of shipping a deep learning project. This course teaches full-stack production deep learning:   

- Formulating the problem and estimating project cost  
- Finding, cleaning, labeling, and augmenting data  
- Picking the right framework and compute infrastructure  
- Troubleshooting training and ensuring reproducibility  
- Deploying the model at scale
